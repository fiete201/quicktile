    IMPORTANT: Sphinx's text output silently erases hyperlinks without
    presenting the URLs in another fashion and renders inline images in a
    somewhat ugly style. Please bear this in mind when editing.

    IMPORTANT: THIS DOCUMENT IS AUTOGENERATED. To update it, modify
    docs/authors/index.rst in the QuickTile source distribution and run
    docs/update_authors.sh

    NOTE: Due to limitations in Sphinx's generation of text output, attribution
    URLs are missing from this version and the textual rendering of inline
    images is less than ideal. The HTML version included in the QuickTile
    manual should be preferred where possible.

The Program
-----------

QuickTile is primarily the work of `Stephan Sokolow`_, however, it has received
various contributions over the years.

Thanks go out to the following people:

`David Stygstra`_
    Generalized the ``move-to-center`` command into the ``move-to-*`` family
    of commands.

`Gustavo J A M Carneiro`_ and `Filip Van Raemdonck`_
    Created the ``gtkexcepthook`` module in `the form I started from
    <https://gist.github.com/sysfs/f0fce1fd90ddede02701fd5fcaee3304>`_.

Justin
    Added the ``horizontal-maximize``, ``vertical-maximize``, and
    ``move-to-center`` commands.

`Matthias Putz`_
    Fixed use of an uninitialized variable in a difficult-to-trigger failure
    case.

`Max Weiß`_

    * Added the ``KEYLOOKUP`` dict to compensate for un-intuitive omissions for
      the symbol names of common keys.
    * Reworked the shebang to address the period when some Linux distros lacked
      a :command:`python2` binary while others linked :command:`python` to
      Python 3.

`Oliver Gerlich`_
    Corrected an omission on the list of dependencies for CentOS 7 and possibly
    other Red Hat-family distros.

`Stéphane Gourichon`_

    * Researched how to create ``.deb`` packages
    * Wrote :file:`recompile_local_debian_package.sh`
    * Set up the necessary package metadata for building a ``.deb``.

`Stuart Axelbrooke`_
    Corrected a flaw in the window-tiling heuristics which prevented them
    from functioning correctly on especially large monitors.

`Thomas Vander Stichele`_
    Helped to clean up the API documentation during the ePyDoc_ era.

`Valdis Vitolins`_
    Added an omitted dependency on ``python-setuptools`` to :file:`README.rst`

`Valentin Agachi`_
    Corrected window-layout calculations to use :py:func:`round` for pixel
    values.

`Yuting/Tim Xiao`_
    Made the window-tiling heuristics more robust.

`Fritz Reichwald`_
    Added ``Gtk.init_check`` in ``quicktile.__main__`` to work around a 
    bug in some builds of GTK.

    NOTE: For "Yuting/Tim Xiao", the commits are signed "Yuting Xiao" but the
    name on the associated GitHub account has since been changed to "Tim Xiao".
    I am operating on the assumption that this is a case of "Yuting" being the
    contributor's legal name and "Tim" being a nickname the contributor has
    taken to more easily interact with peers... it's apparently a common
    practice.
